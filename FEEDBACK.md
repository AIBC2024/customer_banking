Hello Ingrid,



Congratulations on an amazing assignment and great job implementing the savings account, CD account, and main functions for this banking application.



For the savings account function, you properly imported the Account class, instantiated it, calculated interest earned, updated the balance, and set the new balance and interest back into the account object before returning the updated values. This showcases skills working with classes and methods in Python.



Similarly, the CD account function instantiated the account, computed interest, set the new balance and interest earned, and returned the updated details. Reusing the Account class and applying similar logic between the functions demonstrates good code reuse and consistency.



The main function gave a nice user interface by prompting for key inputs like initial balances, rates, and months. Printing formatted output of the interest earned and updated balances displays core programming skills. And calling main() to run the program ties the pieces together.



Overall, your account functions, use of class methods, calculations, return values, and main control flow meet all requirements and exhibit strong Python coding skills. The calculations are accurate and the output properly demonstrates the banking operations. Nice work on this assignment!
